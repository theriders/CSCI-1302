compile my program my running 'make'
the class files can be deleted by running 'make clean'

my test file creates a CustomerOrder object and then calls its displayMenu() which starts the menu for the entire program

Drink, Appetizer, and Pizza all call their printHeading() and displayMenu() from their constructors, although they also
have overwritten methods that can be called
